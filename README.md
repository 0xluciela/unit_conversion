## About

This tool provides functionality for converting between units of length and mass and adding or subtracting quantities
of different (but compatible) units.

## Dependencies

This tool depends on node.js.

## Installation

In the command line, run the following in the desired directory:

### `git clone https://github.com/0xluciela/unit_conversion.git`

In the project directory, run:

### `node app.js`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Usage

To convert between compatible units, use the dropdown to set the units to convert to and from and enter the numerical value
corresponding to the first unit in the first field. Press the "Compute" button to populate the second field.

To add quantities in potentially differing units, set the units and the corresponding numerical values. The sum should
be displayed in both units below the fields after pressing "Compute."

## Assumptions

This tool was developed on Arch Linux.
